<p>In this post, we’ll learn how to create PDF document from HTML using Puppeteer. We’ll also look at a
    <em>Serverless</em> solution using AWS Lambda. This solution can run on most public clouds and on premises with
    minor or no modifications.
</p>
<h4>Prerequisite:</h4>
<p>You must be familiar with NodeJS &amp; ES6 to follow along the code examples.<br>You must be familiar with AWS Lambda
    &amp; AWS SAM to follow the <em>AWS</em> based <em>Serverless</em> example.</p>
<h3>How do you generate PDF?</h3>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Dk6SjE_rT-qzJA0--Y8Xjw.png" /></figure>
<p>Generally you have a template with placeholders. You need to replace the placeholders with actual data and generate a
    PDF using some compute. The text of the template may come from one team (product and/or legal team), while the look
    and feel of the template may come from another team (UX or CX team). From a developer’s perspective, he/she gets a
    sample PDF (with dummy data as placeholder) on some story on an agile board. Now the developer would reverse
    engineer this sample PDF and develop the code to generate similar PDFs with different sets of data.</p>
<p>Throughout my professional career, I have used multiple tools for generating PDFs including <em>OpenText
        StreamServe</em>, <em>iText</em>, <em>JasperReports</em>, <em>Apache PDFbox, Adobe Coldfusion and jsPDF.
    </em>Being a developer at heart, I certainly have my own bias towards which tool is best among them. In 2017, at
    GDDIndia I was introduced to Puppeteer.(I was there and it was all real. I badly miss being physically present on
    such events ever since Covid-19 has emerged.) Here is the Youtube video of the session.</p><iframe

        href="https://medium.com/media/1ae7521bef933ebe99e57c9bb27ae001/href">https://medium.com/media/1ae7521bef933ebe99e57c9bb27ae001/href</a></iframe>
<p>With just a few lines of code, one can generate a PDF from a HTML page.<br>Is generating a PDF this simple? Yes,
    it is!</p>
<h3>Puppeteer:</h3>
<blockquote>Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the <a
        href="https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/">DevTools Protocol</a>. By default, it launches in
    headless mode and can do everything a modern browser can, including rendering HTML with CSS. It is under <a
        href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/LICENSE">Apache License 2.0</a> and comes with permission
    for commercial use.</blockquote>
<h3>Show me the code</h3>
<p>Here is the code block, which generates a PDF given an URL and a name for the PDF file.</p>
<pre>const puppeteer = require(&#39;puppeteer&#39;);</pre>
<pre>const generatePDF = async (pageUrl, newPdfFileName) =&gt; {<br>   const browser = await puppeteer.launch();<br>   const page = await browser.newPage();<br>   await page.goto(pageUrl, {<br>      waitUntil: &#39;networkidle0&#39;<br>   });<br>   await page.pdf({<br>       path: `/tmp/${newPdfFileName}`,<br>       format: &#39;a4&#39;,<br>       printBackground: true<br>   });<br>   await browser.close();<br>}</pre>
<h3>What does the above code do?</h3>
<p>It uses Puppeteer to launch a browser. Then it opens a new page and navigates to a given URL and waits till the page
    is <em>fully loaded</em> (in the above code fully loaded means, Puppeteer would wait until no new network requests
    are sent for half a second after page load). Then it generates a PDF of the rendered page and finally closes
    the browser.</p>
<h4>Sample Usage:</h4>
<p>The following line of code would create a PDF version of a sample html page using the above function.</p>
<pre>generatePDF(‘https://gsswain.com/print-sample/&#39;, &#39;Print-sample.pdf&#39;);</pre>
<h3>Do I need to host the HTML pages publicly?</h3>
<p><strong>No.</strong><br>1. You need to ensure the above code (when running on some compute) should be able to access
    your html page. You can host the pages privately (on your intranet may be or have a private api which responds with
    html pages to be printed).<br>2. The browser can render local html files with
    <em>file:///&lt;path-to-your-html-page&gt; e.g.
        page.goto(‘</em>file:///Users/gsswain/Documents/gsswain.com/print-sample/index.html’<em>)<br>3. </em>You can
    directly render HTML by calling the<em> page.setContent(&lt;html-to-be-rendered&gt;) </em>method instead of
    calling<em> page.goto() </em>in the above code snippet<em>.</em>
</p>
<h3>How does this solution help?</h3>
<p>The UX/CX team can provide a HTML/CSS based templates rather than providing a sample PDF and you just need to focus
    on replacing the placeholders with actual data and the above function would take care of generating your PDF. If the
    UX/CX team provides a sample PDF, in that case you can either use some tool to convert the PDF into HTML and create
    a template out of that or you can use the expertise of your web developers to create the HTML and CSS based
    templates. Preferably convincing your UX/CX team to provide the HTML templates would be more efficient and make the
    entire process a lot faster.</p>
<p><strong><em>Side note:</em></strong> I personally like the JS template strings to create templates (instead of using
    another tool/framework/library) and some generic JS code which would take care of validation, replacing the place
    holders with real data and finally give me the HTML page to create a PDF. I would write more on this templating
    solution on a different post and would update the link here.</p>
<h3>Have you used this on production?</h3>
<p><em>Short answer-</em> <strong>YES.<br></strong><em>Long answer-</em> I always wanted to use this in production, but
    you know, it’s difficult to convince people 😜. What’s life without meetings!. <strong>This is tested on
        production</strong> and has done really well generating documents with 30–40 pages (most of the testing anyways
    happens on production only 😜). As promised I’ll give a AWS Lambda based Serverless solution.</p>
<h3>Generating PDF from HTML on AWS Lambda</h3>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ABfSa_ESG33cI6wPH4sdxg.png" /></figure>
<p>The above image shows all the AWS resources that we are going to create. I’ll briefly explain the solution below.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Lambda sits behind API Gateway. The API accepts a request payload in JSON format. This payload must contain
        an url for which a PDF needs to be generated. The Lambda generates the required PDF and puts it in a S3 bucket.
        Finally the API responds with a 201 HTTP status code and a location header containing the S3 object URL. (For
        supporting CORS one needs to return the S3 URL in the response body as well.)</li>
    <li>For this example, the S3 bucket has a bucket policy which only allows <strong>public access to objects tagged
            with <em>public=yes.</em></strong>(You should <strong>ideally block public access to S3</strong> and either
        share a S3 Signed URL or a CloudFront Signed URL)</li>
    <li>We also have a Usage plan to restrict the maximum number of requests one can make and an API key is mandatory to
        access the API.</li>
    <li>The Puppeteer dependency is put into a Lambda Layer. Instead of using the <em>puppeteer</em> <em>npm</em>
        library we need to use <em>chrome-aws-lambda </em>as per the troubeleshooting guideline <a
            href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lambda Source Code</h3>
<p>Let’s see the AWS SAM template first</p>
<h4>SAM template (template.yaml)</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 template.yaml %}
<p><em>The </em>Lambda Runtime<em> is </em><em>NodeJS 14.x and the code is written in </em><em>ES6. With </em><em>Node
        14 Module support (specify </em><em>&quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot; in </em><em>package.json) I thought we
        might not have to transpile, but it does not work on </em><em>AWS Lambda yet. The Lambda runtime itself uses a
    </em><em>require(&lt;path-to-handler&gt; for the</em><em>handler configured in the </em><em>Lambda. So we need to
        transpile and I’m transpiling using </em><em>Babel</em>. Look at the package.json and the build.sh files below
    for the transpilation. Also note the Handler in the above template points to the dist directory.</p>
<p>Now let’s see the Lambda code.</p>
<h4>Lambda Handler (pdf-generator/src/app.js)</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 app.js %}
<p>The handler simply delegates to the PDF Generation Request handler.</p>
<h4>Pdf Generation Request Handler (pdf-generator/src/pdf-generation-request-handler.js)</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 pdf-generation-request-handler.js %}
<p>This request handler orchestrates the request. First it converts the Lambda event into a PDF Generation request in
    the constructor (You can take care of any validations here using ValueObject pattern). In the handleRequest method,
    it creates the PDF using the PDF Generation Service, stores it on S3using the S3 PDF Storage Service and finally
    sends the PDF created response.</p>
<h4>Pdf Generation Request Adapter (pdf-generator/src/pdf-generation-request-adapter.js)</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 pdf-generation-request-adapter.js %}
<p>Just picks up the url from the request body and generates a random file name for the PDF. (The name generation code
    can be place in another file or can also be taken as an input in the request payload).</p>
<h4>Pdf Generation Service (pdf-generator/src/pdf-generation-service.js)</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 pdf-generation-service.js %}
<p>This service expects the PDF Generation request. It generates the PDF file in the tmp folder and returns the path to
    the file from the generate method. Notice the difference in terms of the import of chromium and how we launch
    Puppeteer. There is also a DEFAULT_PRINT_OPTIONS which can be overridden by accepting the same in the request
    payload. For this example, the default should do.</p>
<h4>Pdf Storage Service (pdf-generator/src/s3-pdf-storage-service.js)</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 s3-pdf-storage-service.js %}
<p>This stores the file on S3 and <em>returns the HTTP based object URL</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> When running on local with sam local start-api, if we set the MODE to SAM_LOCAL, then
    it would not try to upload to S3, instead return a dummy URL.</p>
<h4>PDF Generation Request (pdf-generator/src/pdf-storage-request.js)</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 pdf-storage-request.js %}
<h4>S3 PDF Storage Request Adapter (pdf-generator/src/s3-pdf-storage-request-adapter.js)</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 s3-pdf-storage-request-adapter.js %}
<p>This takes care of creating a PutObjectCommand for storing the PDF. We are tagging the object with public=yes and the
    ContentDisposition is set to attachment which would start downloading the file on a browser.</p>
<h4>File Service (pdf-generator/src/file-service.js)</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 file-service.js %}
<p>This file returns a read stream for a file.</p>
<h4>Pdf Generation Response Adapter (pdf-generator/src/pdf-generation-response-adapter.js)</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 pdf-generation-response-adapter.js %}
<p>This converts the response as expected by AWS API Gateway.</p>
<h4>Config (pdf-generator/src/config.js)</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 config.js %}
<p>Use this Config file instead of reading the configuration from the environment variables directly everywhere in
    the code.</p>
<h4>package.json (pdf-generator/package.json)</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 package.json %}
<p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong>The transpile script uses Babel to transform the modules to CommonJS</p>
<h4>build.sh</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 build.sh %}
<p>Takes care of transpiling the JS code before running sam build</p>
<h4>.npmignore</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 .npmignore %}

<p>Ignore the tests and src files to be included in the lambda package.</p>
<h4>Lambda Layer package.json (dependencies/nodejs/node14/package.json)</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 layer-package.json %}
<p>This file contains all the dependencies which should go into the Lambda Layer. Also revisit the
    PuppeteerDependencyLayer in the above SAM template.</p>
<h4>main.yml(.github/workflows/main.yml)</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 ci.yml %}
<p>This section is optional and is not a requirement for building and deploying AWS Lambda. You can use your favourite
    CI/CD tool.<br>The above file is a Github Actions workflow configuration file. <strong>This will trigger the build,
        validate the SAM template and then deploy to AWS on git push</strong>. <strong><em>Now that’s real power and
            productivity ❤️</em></strong><em>. </em>You need to set the <strong><em>secrets</em></strong>
    (<em>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</em>, <em>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</em> and <em>AWS_DEFAULT_REGION</em>) in your Github repo for
    this to work.</p>
<p><em>I humbly thank the </em><em>Github team and </em><em>Microsoft for Github Actions.</em></p>
<h4>Parameters for sam local (sam-local-env.json)</h4>
{% gist cc133627507af9e4454308a4c8e68bf6 sam-local-env.json %}
<p>The above file contains the parameter overrides for testing the Lambda on local. One can also use LocalStack for a
    complete integration test (a topic which would need a separate post).</p>
<p>Now that’s all the code. The entire repo is available <a
        href="https://github.com/Girija-Shankar-Swain/html-to-pdf-generator-puppeteer-aws-lambda">here</a> for
    reference. Feel free to send a pull request, if you have any suggestions.</p>
<h3>Build on Local:</h3>
<p>Run the build.sh script to build the project on local.</p>
<h3>Test on Local:</h3>
<p>Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your machine.</p>
<h4>Start the api</h4>
<p>sam local start-api --env-vars sam-local-env.json</p>
<p>Now you can test the API deployed on local, with the following request.</p>
<h4>Sample Request:</h4>
<pre>curl -i -X POST \<br>  <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/generate-pdf/">http://127.0.0.1:3000/generate-pdf/</a> \<br>  -H &#39;cache-control: no-cache&#39; \<br>  -H &#39;content-type: application/json&#39; \<br>  -d &#39;{<br> &quot;url&quot;: &quot;<a href="https://gsswain.com/print-sample/">https://gsswain.com/print-sample/</a>&quot;<br>}&#39;</pre>
<h4>Sample Response:</h4>
<pre>HTTP/1.0 201 CREATED<br>Content-Type: application/json<br>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a><br>location: <a href="https://dummyS3Url/3c8e8e4c-f7b4-4f5b-8e85-8dc06f8a22c3_1615739992609_353075938260911200.pdf">https://dummyS3Url/3c8e8e4c-f7b4-4f5b-8e85-8dc06f8a22c3_1615739992609_353075938260911200.pdf</a><br>Content-Length: 105<br>Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.8.8<br>Date: Sun, 14 Mar 2021 16:39:57 GMT</pre>
<pre>{&quot;pdfUrl&quot;:&quot;https://dummyS3Url/3c8e8e4c-f7b4-4f5b-8e85-8dc06f8a22c3_1615739992609_353075938260911200.pdf&quot;}</pre>
<h3>Deploy on AWS:</h3>
<p>You can use sam deploy --guided to deploy the Lambda.<br>If you use Github as your repo, then you can build and
    deploy using Github Actions which was covered above.<br>For the CI/CD deploy to work, you need to have the
    samconfig.toml file with appropriate values. Refer to the one in my <a
        href="https://github.com/GSSwain/html-to-pdf-generator-puppeteer-aws-lambda">repo</a>.</p>
<h3>Test the deployed solution</h3>
<p>If you have deployed this to your AWS account, you must pass the api key in the headers. You need to go the AWS
    CloudFormation stack and then to the resources. Go to the ApiKey resource and then click show.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bLWB5IFXIPj74mbE0fXAuA.png" /></figure>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*r5AnkOsy6ODVzjAWxciC6Q.png" /></figure>
<p>You can get the URL of the API in the Output section of the AWS CloudFormation Stack.</p>
<p>Now you can test the API deployed on AWS with the following request.</p>
<h4>Sample Request:</h4>
<pre>curl -i -X POST \<br>  <a href="https://lote3qjqz8.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/generate-pdf/">https://&lt;YOUR-API-ID&gt;.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/generate-pdf/</a> \<br>  -H &#39;cache-control: no-cache&#39; \<br>  -H &#39;content-type: application/json&#39; \<br>  -H &#39;x-api-key: &lt;YOUR-API-KEY_GOES_HERE&gt;&#39; \<br>  -d &#39;{<br> &quot;url&quot;: &quot;<a href="https://gsswain.com/print-sample/">https://gsswain.com/print-sample/</a>&quot;<br>}&#39;</pre>
<h4>Sample Response:</h4>
<pre>HTTP/2 201<br>content-type: application/json<br>content-length: 171<br>location: &lt;GENERATED_PDF_URL&gt;<br>date: Sun, 14 Mar 2021 15:26:36 GMT<br>x-amzn-requestid: 8aa9cd12-aaa9-4628-96db-e2d7b952feb5<br>access-control-allow-origin: <a href="https://gsswain.com">https://gsswain.com</a><br>x-amz-apigw-id: cLuuTFlYSwMF5dw=<br>x-amzn-trace-id: Root=1-604e2b28-1cff94e27f34e4e35ec1a6e8;Sampled=0<br></pre>
<pre>{&quot;pdfUrl&quot;:&quot;&lt;GENERATED_PDF_URL&gt;&quot;}</pre>
<p>Copy the pdfUrl value returned in the response and open in a browser and you should see the PDF version of the page.
    Check the tags and metadata in the S3 bucket.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> You can’t access all the objects in the bucket unless you know the bucket key for all
    of them. Also if you upload directly to S3 without the tag public=yes, they can’t be accessed even if you know the
    bucket key. With that we have covered a lot of ground and finally tested our lambda on AWS as well.</p>
<h3>Cleanup:</h3>
<p>After you have done your testing delete all the resources</p>
<h4>Delete all objects in S3 bucket</h4>
<p>aws s3 rm s3://&lt;your-s3-bucket-name&gt; --recursive</p>
<h4>Delete the CloudFormation Stack</h4>
<p>aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name &lt;name-of-your-cfn-stack&gt;</p>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>I hope you learnt a little something and you can use this solution somewhere on production 😊. This is half the
    story. Ideally you would like to have an API which would take a templateId, <strong><em>some data for the template
        </em></strong>and generate a PDF with that. This code example generates a PDF, given a URL. You can easily build
    upon this to support templates. If you are having any issues with Puppeteer<em> </em>while<em> </em>deploying this
    solution to some other platform, please go through the troubleshooting guide <a
        href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em> </strong>There is at least two sides to everything.<strong> </strong>Lambda <strong>is not a
        silver bullet</strong> and you should have some expert opinion before using them for your use case. This
    solution would work best when your target is high throughput rather than low latency. I have intentionally kept the
    ReserverConcurrentExecutions to 1 in the SAM template. Play around the <em>Memory, Concurrency</em> mode for your
    use case. If you need help do reach out to me.</p>
