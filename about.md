## About Me

Hi, I'm **Girija** — a **seasoned software engineer** with **15+ years** of experience solving complex business problems through innovative technology solutions and exceptional leadership. I specialize in **cloud-native architectures, microservices, and building high-performing engineering teams** that deliver measurable business impact.

As a professional, I have **architected, designed, developed, and scaled event-driven cloud-native enterprise applications** using Domain Driven Design, Microservices, Serverless, and Micro Frontends for various FinTechs across the globe.

I believe in building **purpose-built simple cohesive systems** working together to solve bigger problems. I love getting my hands dirty with emerging technologies, understanding their trade-offs, and using them where they fit best — always making life simpler for developers, business, customers, and everyone in between.
